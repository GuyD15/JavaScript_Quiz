#Timed_coding_quiz

##Description

The project was to make a timed quiz with questions about JavaScript coding. When you answer incorrectly, the quiz takes time away. At the end of the quiz you save your highscore and are able to see other highscores as well. They stay there until the user clicks the clear highscores button. 

I built this project to help grow my skills with local storage, event listeners, as well as other coding fundamentals.

I learned how one line of code can throw off multiple functions. I had a hard time getting the highscores to log after the initial one was submitted. I had to work on both the save and print highscores functions in order to get this corrected.

##Usage
